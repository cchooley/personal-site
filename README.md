# Conor Hooley's Portfolio Site

(screenshot.png)

This site is meant to showcase my work and serve as a networking asset for connecting with the development community.

## Installation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8. To get the Angular CLI, run `npm install -g @angular/cli`

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Serving

Run `ng serve` for a dev client server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm test` for a dev database server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. Testing CRUD functionality with Postman (https://www.getpostman.com/) highly recommended.
