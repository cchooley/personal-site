      <p>So far I've used a slew of technologies and languages to build apps and sites for an array of different clients.</p>
      <p>Click on any of the above for a description of the project and a link to check each one out in all of its (debatable) glory.</p>

      <p>This is a full-stack app that was built for Aurora, CO's <a href="http://www.vintagetheatre.com/">Vintage Theatre</a>, one of the largest non-profit live theatres in
        Colorado.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vintage required a means of tracking the registry for their Youth Program's summer camp, which accepts both paid enrollees
        as well as scholarship students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using PostgreSQL, Knex.js, and Express.js, I built an API that would offer persisting registration data on enrollees and
        record whether they are paid students or scholarship recipients.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the frontend, I built a single page application with Angular that offers all relevant program information, as well as
        relevant forms for paid vs. scholarship. It also has an "Admin" section that allows administrators to track enrollment
        in all forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still needed: I hope to soon integrate Stripe to capture payments as well as a feature like OAuth that will allow for administrators
        to log in and access the "Admin" section (and, of course, to keep the general public from accessing it!)

        This app is demos a crucial aspect of a larger, long-term project called GOGOT that I am working on another colleague. We
        came up with the idea for this game before Game of Thrones’ fifth season that kind of caught fire - essentially formatting
        the “Survivor Pool” NFL game to apply to HBO's Game of Thrones.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GOGOT app, including this demo version, is chiefly designed to administer and record weekly selections. This would be
        something that could identify a player, present them with the eligible characters for selection, log their pick and display
        the week’s selections. All in an efficient and stylish way.
      </p>
      <p>
        My objective for this project was to use Angular to code the aforementioned game logic into a workable demo, and in those
        terms it functions exactly how I’d like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still needed: A final, truly-playable version will require components that will create and store player accounts, store weekly pick information
        for characters and players alike, and conditionally open and close the weekly selections at the correct times (last season
        the pick period typically ran from Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon through the Sunday evening start time of that week’s episode).
        I’d also love to add a message board for trash talk and some other peripheral aspects that players can geek out on - episode
        info, memes, quotes, etc.
